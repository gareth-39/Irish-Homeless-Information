# Irish-Homeless-Information

This is my website, its called Irish Homeless Information. I set this website as my my project as i had an interact with a young family about to become homeless who said to me all the information from all the different pages was very confusing, not only that but they had no internet apart from when they went into shops were they could quickly connect to the shops wifi. But some of the shops wanted them to buy stuff so they need to get the informatin as quickly as possible.

This got me thinking if there was just one website that anyone in this situation or about to come into this situation could get what they needed like a one stop informatin portal. They could click on to the page and in seconds be on another with all the information they need. The sign up page if published would allow you to sign up and get notified to any changes to the information page external websites, phone numbers or services.<br><br>
